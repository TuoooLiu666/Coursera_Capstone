    "As a two-week IBM Data Science professional certificate program Capstone Project, I will work on real datasets to get a taste of what a typical day of data scientist is like in real life. Main objectives of this project were to define a business problem, look for data in the web and, use Foursquare location data to compare different neighborhoods of Toronto to figure out which neighborhood is suitable for starting a new Chinese restaurant. We will go through all the process step by step from problem description, data preparation, analyses and finally will provide a conclusion that can be leveraged by the business stakeholders to make their decisions."
